# DigitalBoard

The intention of this project is to create a digital departure Board. The Board should show the departures of Berlin Hauptbahnhof, Berlin Grünbergallee *(S-Bahn Station)*. Further:  for Grünbergallee I've implemented a traffic light system to show whether a certain train can still be reached if you leave your apartment now.

The Board also shows additional information, e.g. when a train is delayed or if there is a reason why the train service is disrupted.

This Project is ment to be used in private and not in a commercial manner.
